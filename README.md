# Hello Books React Front-End

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e02a75673a3b4a1eb187e5aa067e894e)](https://app.codacy.com/app/3V0L/hellobooks-cp4?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=3V0L/hellobooks-cp4&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This is the front-end to the [HelloBooks-API](https://github.com/3V0L/hellobooks_api) that I made using Python. The front end will be connected to a hosted version of the API that can be found on [Heroku](https://hellobooks-tapiwa.herokuapp.com/). This app will be done in ReactJS and will make use of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a responsive front end application which connects to the above mentioned API.
